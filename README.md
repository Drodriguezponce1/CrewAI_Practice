# CrewAI_Practice

This Repository is focused on learned CrewAI through a course on deeplearning.ai

This project revolves around expanding the deeplearning courses project about tailoriong a job application. I wanted to take a step forward and implement other agents to it.

Additions:
- Given a PDF version of a resume, make sure that the agent fully understands it and converts that into a markdown file
- I ended up creating different classes for each of the agents to have some level of abstraction and readability
- Work Flow:
    - Read/dissect/understand the resume
    - Look into the companies history based on a role
    - look into a job description
    - Next, I want the agents to focus on making suggestions to better my resume based on the above
    - Create agents that give you advice using the STAR method for interviews
    - Lastly, Want to add user input (WIP)

Thanks to deeplearning for helping me start this personal project: https://learn.deeplearning.ai/
